          FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING
          FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. OUR LIABILITY TO YOU IS LIMITED TO THE
          AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US, IF ANY. CERTAIN LAWS MAY NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS

        <h2>19. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Your use of the Services.</li>
          <li>Your breach of these Legal Terms.</li>
          <li>Your violation of third-party rights.</li>
          <li>Any harmful act toward another user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defence of any matter

        </p>

        <h2>20. USER DATA</h2>
        <p>
          We will maintain data you transmit to the Services for managing
          performance. You are solely responsible for all data you transmit. We
          are not liable for any loss or corruption of your data.

        <h2>21. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES</h2>

        <p>
          These Legal Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us.
          Our failure to enforce any right does not waive that right. These
